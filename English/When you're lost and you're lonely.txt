When you're lost and you're lonely
And your only way is up
When your day rises from you
Like a mountain to its top
Look beside you and you will find me
I will guide you when your will is gone
So carry on, carry on, carry on
What ever comes and however painful, however long
When your hope has been denied you
I will walk beside you, carry on
All my life has been a battle
Fought within me with myself
You always know what the truth is
But the trick is to know yourself
I looked around me in the darkness
And you found me
When there was no one else
So carry on, carry on, carry on
Whatever comes and however painful, however long
When your hope has been denied you
I will walk beside you, carry on
Let me count the ways that I love you
Let me count the days that we have known
Show me a place to be with you
'cause I can't do this on my own, on my own
So carry on, carry on, carry on
What ever comes and however painful, however long
When your hope has been denied you
I will walk beside you, carry on
So carry on, carry on, carry on
Whatever comes and however painful, however long
When your hope has been denied you
I will walk beside you, carry on
When your hope has been denied you
I will walk beside you, carry on
